*PyTorch Geometric Temporal* is a temporal (dynamic) extension library for [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric).

<p align="justify">The library consists of various dynamic and temporal geometric deep learning, embedding, and spatio-temporal regression methods from a variety of published research papers. Moreover, it comes with an easy-to-use dataset loader, train-test splitter and temporal snaphot iterator for dynamic and temporal graphs. The framework naturally provides GPU support. It also comes with a number of benchmark datasets from the epidemological forecasting, sharing economy, energy production and web traffic management domains. Finally, you can also create your own datasets.</p>
